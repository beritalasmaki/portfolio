 * React state: each section already owns its open/closed state locally
 * (matching this codebase's established preference — see AboutMe's
 * per-row independent hover state — for state to live as close to the
 * thing it controls as possible), and TOC has no reason to know which ids
 * are accordions versus plain anchors; dispatching unconditionally on

// centering two *boxes* that didn't visually align (confirmed by eye and
// by comparing rendered screenshots). `currentColor` picks up the
// wrapping span's text color, so it still follows the same
// muted -> accent-dark hover/focus swap as before.

 * A collapsible page section ("How it started", "Challenges &
 * Problem-Solving", "What I would do differently"), presented as a white
 * card (`rounded-card border border-rule bg-white p-card-pad`) — the same
 * treatment given to the plain sections around it (Starting Point,
 * ImpactSection), so the page reads as one consistent
 * "each section is a card" system rather than the accordions looking like
 * a visually distinct, separately-styled control. The heading doubles as
 * the toggle button; it carries no background fill of its own — the
 * "Show more/less" label plus the rotating chevron are what mark it as
 * interactive, not a shaded box behind the text.
 *
 * The panel is always in the DOM (not conditionally rendered) and animates
 * via the `grid-template-rows: 0fr -> 1fr` technique — animates to an
 * intrinsic, unmeasured height in pure CSS, same pattern as AboutMe's
 * WorkingWithMe rows. Unlike those rows, nothing here needs the
 * absolute-overlay workaround: a click-toggled, page-level accordion
 * pushing the sections below it down as it opens is expected, normal
 * behavior, not an accidental side effect competing with a hovering mouse.
