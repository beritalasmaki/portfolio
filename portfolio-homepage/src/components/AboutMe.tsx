/**
 * One "Working with me" row. Four things worth calling out:
 *
 * 1. Hover/focus state is local to each row (not lifted to the parent), so
 *    hovering row N never programmatically forces row N-1 to close — each
 *    row only reacts to the mouse actually entering/leaving *its own*
 *    bounds.
 * 2. The detail card sits directly on top of the row it belongs to
 *    (`absolute inset-0`, exactly the button's own box), not in the space
 *    above or below it — the two cross-fade with a slow, soft transition
 *    (a blur filter was tried here first and read as fussy/distracting
 *    rather than calm, so it's gone). Since the detail card never leaves
 *    its own row's footprint, it can't encroach on a neighboring row the
 *    way an adjacent-space reveal could, so unlike that approach every row
 *    behaves identically — no "last row has nowhere to open into" case to
 *    special-case.
 * 3. Only the (non-interactive) overlay scales in — the button itself only
 *    fades, never scales. Scaling the button was tried first too, and
 *    broke hover almost immediately (confirmed by sampling `aria-expanded`
 *    every 50ms): shrinking the very element whose `onMouseLeave` drives
 *    `hovered` shrinks its own hit-tested hitbox out from under a
 *    stationary cursor, firing that `onMouseLeave` before the transition
 *    even finishes. The overlay has no such risk since it's
 *    `pointer-events-none` (see 4), so it's free to scale.
 * 4. The overlay is `pointer-events-none` in *every* state, not just while
 *    collapsed. It has to be: it sits precisely on top of the button that
 *    controls it, so if it ever accepted pointer events, the moment it
 *    faded in the cursor would suddenly be "over" the overlay instead of
 *    the button beneath it — firing that button's `onMouseLeave`, which
 *    hides the overlay, which hands hover back to the button, which
 *    re-fires `onMouseEnter`... a flicker loop. Letting every pointer
 *    event pass through to the button underneath avoids it entirely.

            Growing up in a small town in Finland, I never expected to end up in tech, let alone design. I studied
            IT and web development, but my real start in design happened almost by accident: a friend brought me
            into his startup while I was still in high school, and that&apos;s where I first got hands-on
            experience with both design tools and code. I&apos;ve been curious about both ever since.
          </p>
          <p className="m-0 text-body-lg text-body">
            Ten years in design, nine of them as a consultant, taught me to move between very different worlds:
            public sector platforms, industrial tools, environmental data systems, often as the only designer in
            the room. I&apos;ve worked on more than 25 projects, and each one shaped how I work today. That kind of
            work forces you to care about your craft, because there might not be anyone else to catch what you
            miss.
          </p>
          <p className="m-0 text-body-lg text-body">
            I value quality work, clear focus, and strong collaboration. Instead of worrying about how AI is
            changing design, I take a practical approach: I use the tools that make sense, keep improving my
            process, and keep building solid product experiences.
